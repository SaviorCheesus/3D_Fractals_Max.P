# 3D_Fractals_Max.P
Fractals. But in 3D.

<h2> Goals and inspiration </h2>

<p>
The goal of this relatively simple project is to and adapt some of my prior 
knowledge learned in the past few months, and apply them in a project. 
I wanted to do something 3D, as I had not used it all too much.
<p>

<h2> MileStone 1 : May 12th </h2>

<p> 
By this time, I want to have most of the basic elemants implemented into the project, 
which includes all of the collision, camera, and physics code. 
Since I have alread dabbled into some of these things in previous projects, 
I it should be relatively easy to adapt those pieces of code to my project right here.
It would also be preferable to have a few fractals done by the end of this milestone,
preferably seirpinskis pyramid, and his cube. 
Since I have a little bit of past experience with fractals, this should be managable.
I would also like to have figured out a library that I could use with it, other than
my camera library.
<p>

<h2> MileStone 2 : May 19th </h2>

<p>
By this time, I want to be done with all of the fractals in this, 
implementing a few more complex fractels, possibly even non-stationary ones,
and improving some of the pallet of the whole thing, 
to give it more visual appeal. Whichever library I will have chosen by then, I want to have it
implemented by this deadline.
<p>

<h2> MileStone 2 : May 24th </h2>

<p>
Order all the fractels in such a way that they are easily visable and execable, 
as though it were a bit of an exhibition. This time should also be used to iron out bugs
and any other problems not previously seen, if they arise.
